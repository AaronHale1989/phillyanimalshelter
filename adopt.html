          <div class="Information">
            <div class="box e"><p>Khater is a big couch potato, who LOVES snuggling, and positive human affection.  This smart boy knows several commands, is mostly housebroken, and absolutely thrives on a good routine! He's bouncy and active and love to be your running buddy, and fetch has to be in his Top Favorite Things Forever list.<br>
            <br>This dog sounds amazing! Why is he still here?! You're probably asking yourself right now. Khater is a very strong guy so he needs an adopter who is able to take him on walks. Khater also would not do well in a city setting. This dogs need some big space and Khater gets very distracted on walks if a lot of people or animals are around.</p></div>
            <div class="box f"><p>Willow is the sweetest thing in the whole city right now! She is gentle and nice, more on the quieter side of the feline nature. Although Willow is shy at first and may hide from you, if you are patient and quiet, she will come out of her hiding place and slowly warm up to you. and once she trusts you, voila! We believe she will be best in a home with other calm and friendly feline friend or in a loving home with a quiet ambience. She is a little wary young children and loud noises scare her. This is what her foster mom has to say about Willow - "Willow is very cuddly and lovely, she is always by my side wherever I go in my apartment. And sheâ€™s always purring!" If you want to experience the same thing, send an email to Willow's foster mom soon. </p></div>
            <div class="box g"><p>We think that Solace might very well be one of the best dogs on the planet! While this guy has plenty of energy to spare, he uses a lot of it to make sure that he is pleasing you, the handler. <br>
            <br>He knows "sit" and he checks in with you all the time when you are walking together. Nelson would love for you to take time to teach him more things, and he will reward you with all his love. Solace could live with other dogs and older, dog-experienced children, but he would not like to live with cats.</p></div>
            <div class="box h"><p>Introducing the Fabulous Raya!<br>
            <br>Raya is the perfect mix of relaxation and an active desire for attention and cuddles.  He seems to have two modes.  At any given point Mao is quietly relaxing around the house.  When he is not, he is doing everything in his power to get your love, attention and pets.<br>
            <br>Frequently Mao will step up to you, softly place a paw on your arm in the cutest request for petting that we've ever seen.  Raya is fully trained, happy to remain indoors, and wonderful with children.<br>
            <br>Easy and affectionate Raya will capture your heart!
            <br>Happy to provide a meet and greet with this lovely animal!
